# INTRODUCTION
## ASP.NET : 
- ASP.NET is stuffed full of sophisticated features, including tools for implementing security, managing data, storing user-specific information, and much more. And amazingly enough, it’s even possible to program an ASP.NET page without knowing anything about HTML (although a little bit of HTML smarts will help you build your pages more quickly and effectively).
- ASP.NET is designed first and foremost as a server-side programming platform. That means that all ASP.NET code runs on the web server. When the ASP.NET code finishes running, the web server sends the user the final result—an ordinary HTML page that can be viewed in any browser.
